In assignment 1, you will extend the server code to use privilege separation. You should accomplish this by
splitting up the code into two logical parts – the part that sets up the socket and a separate part that 
processes the data from the client. Once you locate this split, you should fork and have the child process 
setuid() to drop its privileges to the “nobody” user. The server should wait for the child to exit and the 
child should process the connection from the client.
